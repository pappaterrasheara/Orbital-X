# OrbitalX

**Supersonic Rocket Vertical Flight Simulator using RK4 Integration**

---

## Overview

OrbitalX simulates the vertical ascent of a supersonic rocket by numerically solving its equations of motion using the Runge-Kutta 4th order (RK4) method. It models realistic atmospheric conditions and calculates altitude, velocity, and Mach number over time.

Flight data is exported to CSV and visualized with plots.
